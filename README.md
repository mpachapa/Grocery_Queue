# Grocery_Queue
This is a java application that was created for a class while I was attending the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. This class was taught by Daniel Jugan, this is a [link](https://webpages.charlotte.edu/djugan/) to his webpage. Progessor Jugan provided the Customer class and required for us to create the Grocery store program as well as the associated queue for the class.

## I used IntelliJ IDEA for this application.

### Grocery.java

### Customer.java

### Queue.java
